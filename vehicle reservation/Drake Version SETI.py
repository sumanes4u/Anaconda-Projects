# SETI Program
#
# The Drake equation, developed by Frank Drake in the 1960s, attempts to
# estimate how many extraterrestrial civilizations, N, may exist in our
# galaxy at any given time that we might come in contact with,
#
#    N = R * p * n * f * i * c * L
#
# where,
#
#    R ... estimated rate of star creation in our galaxy
#    p ... estimated percent of stars that have planets
#    n ... estimated average number of planets that can potentially support
#          life for each star with planets
#    f ... estimated percent of those planets that actually go on to develop life
#    i ... estimated percent of those planets go on to develop intelligent life
#    c ... estimated percent those that are willing and able to communicate
#    L ... estimated expected lifetime of such civilizations
#
# Given that the value for R, 7 per year, is the least disputed, the user
# will be prompted to enter estimated values for the rest of the factors and
# the estimated number of civilizations that may be detected in our galaxy
# will be displayed.
